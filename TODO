1. This mempool uses pthread lib and share memory to implement the lock mechanism. Need to write our own mempool lock algorithm.

2. Finish the utility functions so that the memory leak and using status could be tracked.

3. Implement other memory allocation algorithms for this mempool lib.

4. Need a better way to generate the uniq index for created mempool.

Please feel free to contact me.
